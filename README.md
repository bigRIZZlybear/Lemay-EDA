# Lemay-EDA
I decided to use this dataset because it was a very simple text dataset with data that I am familiar with. I was able to do basic EDA on it in a jupyter notebook and I found some valuable insights. I found that there were not a lot of differences regarding total word count, mean word count, and standard deviation on word count between the positive and negative reviews. I also found that the top 10 words used between the two datsets were also similar. The only difference in the two datasets were the polarity scores. The positive reviews had a higher distribution of polarity scores than the negative reviews. We can see this in the histograms that the postivereviews distrbution was more skewed to the right while the negative reviews were more normally distributed/ sckewed to the left.
